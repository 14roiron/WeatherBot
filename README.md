# WeatherBot
3D Printable Weather Forecasting Theatre | ESP32 &amp; OpenWeatherMap

Meet WeatherBot, my WiFi connected weather forecasting machine. WeatherBot retrieves a local forecast from OpenWeatherMaps and then shows you tomorrows weather with a motorised mini diorama.

The additional e-ink display provides a more precise insight into today and tomorrows weather patterns. I’ll show you step by step how to make your own. 

I have written and created a video containing full build instrucitons and a guide on using this code on my website: https://www.diymachines.co.uk/weatherbot-3d-printable-weather-forecasting-theatre

## List of items used in this project and where to find them:

* Waveshare 2.9” E-ink Display (296x128): https://geni.us/E-inkDisplay1

    * Note: There are reports of the linked E-Ink display not working with the current code. This will be investigated.

* Electrical wire: https://geni.us/22AWGWire

* ESP32 (x1): https://geni.us/ESP32

    * Note: Amazon Link is outdated if you are going to use the PCB design. PCB Design requires 30 Pin ESP32.
    * I am attempting to use [These](https://www.amazon.com/Development-Microcontroller-Integrated-Antenna-Amplifiers/dp/B09GK74F7N/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=VFRPS8IX7O6F&keywords=esp32+30p&qid=1675775058&sprefix=esp32+30p%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWUkxEVlhQTTZTN1gmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAxODM2ODUyNEM2MTBMUUM1QTZFJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwNzMyMDYyMk1HVTU1Tlk0V0tXJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==)

* Micro continuous / 360 degree rotation servos (x4): https://geni.us/FS90R

* PCB: https://geni.us/WeatherBotPCB

    * Note: Link is outdated if you are going to use the ESP32 Amazon Link. PCB Design requires 30 Pin ESP32

* USB cable (for uploading code and powering project): https://geni.us/MicroUSBCable

* M2.5x14 Bolts (x12), M2.5x8 Bolts (x7) and Nuts (x10): https://geni.us/M2-5BoltKit

* 90 Degree / Corner Header Pins: https://geni.us/90DegreeHeaderPins

* 3mm thick wood for laser cut scene discs (x4 A4 size): https://geni.us/3mmPlywood

* Projects PCB: https://geni.us/WeatherBotPCB 

## Fixed SVGs
I have updated the SVGs as the original ones were generated by whatever software the SnapMaker uses for design and were very difficult to use.
* Invisible/barely visible artifacts removed (messed with resizing)
* Duplicate objects removed
* Outlines and rain cleaned up 
* Resized to correct dimension (160mmx160mm) 
* Disc 4 split into three seperate SVGs (line, fill, cut)
  * Please note, the fill layer will not perfectly align automatically as it has a different bounding box than any other set of SVGs. It will need to be aligned manually by the user.

# Original Creator, DIYMachines, Also Provides the Info Below I Have Included Verbatim

These are some of my favourite tools I use and can recommend:

* Battery-powered glue gun: http://geni.us/BoschBatteryGlueGun

* Bosch Bit Driver: https://geni.us/Bosch-Screwdriver 

I use a Prusa MK3S for my projects and highly recommend both it and the Prusa Mini. If I inspired you to take up 3D printing please consider purchasing a printer via this link: http://shop.prusa3d.com/#a_aid=diymachines

Prusa support my channel when you use that link at no cost to yourself. :)
